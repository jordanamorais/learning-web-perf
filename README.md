## How the browser constructs a page?

## To dos to a better performance

* :point_right: Always analyse your website in your phone.

> Why? - Cellular phones are much more limited in features: slower CPUs, less RAM and GPU memory, higher connection latencies, etc. As a result, you'll always need to analyze and debug your site on mobile hardware to get a more accurate sense of the experience users will have on your site on mobile devices.

## Web Performance Tools

* [Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) - This tool from Google analyse and generate suggestions in order to improve your website performance.
